# This is CarPool README

CarPool is a social networking application (In Progress) to assist any given person reach any destination in the metropolitan area. The main idea is that everybody can be a driver or a passenger. Drivers can post and charge a fee for their routes and the passengers can reserve those routes, they can also review and post feedback about the driver. At the moment the project is focused on university students who can't afford to their own car or pay a bus or a ticket plane to go to another city. We know there are other applications that make something like this (Uber, Lyft etc). But what we want is to provide a safety emotion, a secure way (Using authentication with Facebook or other Social Networking application). Imagine all the possible rides people can have making it cheaper for the passengers and for the drivers who can earn extra cash just completing an everyday chore.
